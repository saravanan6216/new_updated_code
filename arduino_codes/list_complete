 ===============================================================================

 1.	How Digital Pins Work with Analog Values (PWM)

 	Set an Analog Value - Change the Brightness of an LED

 2.	Make an LED Fade in/out

 3.	Read a Digital Value - Detect When the Button is Pressed

 	Power on an LED Only if the Button is Pressed

 4.	Read an Analog Value From the Potentiometer

 	Activity 04 - Set the LED Brightness with the Potentiometer

 5.	Create a Small Traffic Light System

 6.	Blink 3 LEDs When the Button is not Pressed( with Functions and Arrays )

 7.	Set an LED Blink Rate from the Serial Monitor

 8.	Blink Multiple LEDs without delay() (Multitask: Run 3 Actions Simultaneously)@

 9.	Debounce the Push Button(Toggle a Different LED when Pressing on the Button)

 10.	Count How Many Times you Press on the Push Button with Interrupts 

 11.	Save and Retrieve Values with EEPROM 

 12.	Ultrasonic Sensor Works + pulseIn() function
 	    Power on a Different LED Depending on the Distance From an Obstacle
 	    Print Distance From Obstacle on LCD Screen

 13.	Choose which LED to Power on with the Remote Controller 

 14.	Power on LEDs if itâ€™s Getting too Dark(Photoresistor)

 15.	Interfacing of high voltage device with Arduino
 	    Turn on and off bulb after some duration

 16.	Arduino to Arduino I2C Example

 17.	Arduino to Arduino SPI Example

 18.	Arduino to Arduino UART Example

 19.	Reading and Writing to and From SD Card Module

 

LPC2148 & STM32xx
